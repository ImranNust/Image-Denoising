# Details of Pre Processing Steps

First, we will run ```generate_train_gaus.m``` file to generate `300,000` images of sizes $60\times60$ in the **hdf5** format from [DIV2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/) train dataset. The generated dataset would contain both the original images and their corresponding labels for noise levels **10**, **30**, and **50**.
